# DFA and CFG Library

This repository contains a library for working with Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) and Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) in the Racket programming language.

## Description

The library provides functionalities to work with DFAs and CFGs, including the following features:

- Creation and manipulation of deterministic finite state acceptors (DFAs).
- Generation of random strings from regular expressions.
- Parsing and generation of random parse trees from context-free grammars.
- Determining whether a given DFA accepts a given string.
- Listing leaf labels from labeled trees.
- Generating strings from CFGs.


## Usage

To use the library, you can include the necessary files (`main.rkt`) in your Racket project. 

## Dependencies

This library is entirely written in the Racket programming language. It has no external dependencies.
